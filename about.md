I am a final year PhD student under the Erasmus-Mundus Joint Doctorate Program in **Animal Breeding and Genetics** [EGS-ABG](http://www.egsabg.eu/), jointly hosted by **Aarhus University** [Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics (QGG)](http://mbg.au.dk/en/research/research-centres/center-for-quantitative-genetics-and-genomics/) and **AgroParisTech** [Génétique Animale et Biologie Intégrative (GABI)](https://www6.jouy.inra.fr/gabi/). 
The focus of my PhD project is the use of whole-genome sequences to identify recessive genetic defects in dairy cattle. 

Currently, I am working on following:
* deletion genotyping using Gaussian mixture model [GMM for genotypeing](http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/128029891/genotype_call_chromosomal_deletions_using_read_depth_whole_genome_sequence_variants_cattle.pdf)
* building haplotype reference for imputing chromosomal deletions [ImputeDelPipeline](https://github.com/MMesbahU/ImputeDelPipeline)
* GWAS and meta-analysis for female fertility using imputed whole-genome sequence variants and large deletions [GWAS](https://github.com/MMesbahU/gwas_in_cattle)
* Prediction of breeding values
